      <h2>My Story</h2><br/>

      <p><b>JESUS ALBERTO CUEVAS</b> (Born April 17 1992), known to his city as "JB" or "Jezeus Cuevas" is an independent Mexican artist from Pasadena, California.</p>
      <br/> 
      <p>In 2012, Cuevas dropped his first studio mixtape called, "From Mexico With Love" aka "FMWL" while sitting in a local bookstore in Santa Monica, California. Cuevas started gaining more attention in early 2013 when he dropped his first EP, "From Dena To Watts" where he collaborate with Ron aka Veez. Both artists had a lot to say about the black and brown community and they both began to work on the story the EP would tell. Following a theme from the film, "American Gangster", a small sound clip was played between each song that fit perfectly with the message of the tracks. Despite the record being only 6 songs, it was a huge hit in the community. The album covered the similarities of Pasadena and Watts and the similarities between African Americans and Latinos in the communities.</p> 
      <br/>
      <p>During the summer of 2013, Jezeus decided to release his second independent "basement record".  IZZY 2014 was dropped on July 23rd 2013, featuring his producer, "Veez" in two tracks. The album instantly became a favorite among his fans.  The tracks discussed in more detail and depth more personal and difficult topics in his life. Jezeus explains his relationship with his daughter and the difficulties in dealing with not having her in his life, although he was there the day of her birth. He discusses the experiences he had as a father who was able to witness such a beautiful moment in his life. He explains in his words "This is definitely a must hear. I mean, after talking about the hood and how we lived, what I did to make money, this tape is much more refreshing. You know I have a daughter whom I havenâ€™t seen and I hope and pray 2014 is the year I get her back into my life...which is why the tape is called 'IZZY 2014'".</p>
      <br/>
      <p>Jezeus Cuevas is set to release an early EP called "JEZEUS" in late 2014.  Leaving what he went by for the past 2 years as JB, and ready to  release another home studio Mixtape "Kontradictions".</p>

      <p>You are not only listening to a simple mixtape. You're following a campaign and helping me reach this goal and vision.</p>
